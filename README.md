# two-by-two-solver

This code is intended to be used with a 2x2 rubik's cube and a heavily modified version of the MindCuber for the Lego MINDSTORMS EV3. The cube being used for this project is a white colour plastic square V-cube 2.

However, the cube had to be modified in two ways for this project. First off, the black sticker with the V-cube logo was coloured in with a black Sharpie so that the sensor does not confuse a black input for something else.

The colour sensor was not able to measure orange, so the orange stickers on the cube had to be peeled off.
